Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap for responsive and mobile-friendly design, ensuring consistent user experience across devices of different screen sizes.

<------------Frontend Code Structure---------------->
The frontend codebase of the E-Commerce project follows a modular structure, with components organized into separate files and directories for improved maintainability and scalability. The main entry point for the frontend application is the App.js file, which serves as the root component and orchestrates the overall structure and behavior of the application.

// App.js
// Main entry point for the frontend application, orchestrating routing, authentication, and integration with external services.


<======================Backend==================>
The backend of the E-Commerce project is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust foundation for handling requests, managing data, and orchestrating interactions with external services such as databases and payment gateways.

Error Handling: Implements robust error handling middleware to gracefully handle errors and maintain application stability, providing meaningful error messages to users and developers.
Email Notification: Utilizes Nodemailer for sending email notifications, including account verification emails and password reset functionalities to enhance user experience and security.


<-----------------Backend Code Structure----------------------->
The backend codebase of the E-Commerce project consists of two main files: app.js and server.js, each responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality.

app.js: Configures the Express application, sets up middleware, defines routes, and handles errors.
server.js: Initializes the server, handles uncaught exceptions, and manages server shutdown.

// app.js
// Express application configuration, including middleware setup, route definition, and error handling.

// server.js
// Server initialization, uncaught exception handling, and graceful shutdown management.


<==============Additional Features================>
In addition to the core features, the E-Commerce project incorporates several advanced functionalities to enhance user experience, application robustness, and performance:

Pagination: Implements pagination for efficiently browsing large datasets, enhancing performance and user experience by limiting the number of records displayed per page.
Sorting and Filtering: Provides sorting and filtering options for product search, allowing users to find products based on specific criteria such as price, category, or popularity.
